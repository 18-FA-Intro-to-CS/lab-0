# Introduction to Computer Science - Fall 2018
## Lab 0 - You need to Git

**Purpose:** This purpose of this lab is to get some practice with basic interaction with Python and the basics of the _Git Version Control System (VCS)_. The assignment has two parts. The Python part and the git part.

**Assumptions:** This assignment assumes that you have already set up a GitHub account and have Python installed in your workspace.

**Part 1 - Cloning the Repository:** After accepting the assignment, clone this repository into your workspace of choice (this will be covered in class).

**Part 2 - Instructions:** Create a Python script file called *animal.py*. Create a **main()** function as demonstrated in the text. Your main function should do the following things:

* It should ask the user for his/her name.
* It should then greet the user by name.
* It should then print four or five sentences of text informing the user about an animal of your choice.

The examples in Chapter 1 of the text should give you everything you need to accomplish this, but if there are any questions or confusion *please* make sure you contact the instructor.

Once you are finished, you can simply push the repository back to GitHub using either the Windows client or the command line interface with the following commands:

`````
    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "Some commit message."
    $ git push -u origin master
`````

If you have trouble with these commands or the Windows client, ask the instructor or refer to the provided course resources.
